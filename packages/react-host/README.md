# @appshell/react-host

Appshell React host for building micro-frontends with Appshell and Webpack Module federation.

Working examples can be found [here](https://github.com/navaris/appshell/tree/main/examples).

`@appshell/react-host` is published as a docker image and dynamically loads your micro-frontends.

## Getting started

Add a section in your docker-compose.yml to start the react host.

```yaml
services:
  appshell:
    image: appshell/react-host:developer # developer image
    # image: appshell/react-host            # production image
    env_file: './${ENV_TARGET}.env'
    deploy:
      mode: replicated
      replicas: ${APPSHELL_CONTAINER_SCALE}
    ports:
      - ${APPSHELL_PORT}:${APPSHELL_PORT}
    volumes:
      - ./${ENV_TARGET}.env/:/appshell/${ENV_TARGET}.env
      - ./appshell_registry:/appshell/appshell_registry
```

> **Note**
> During development, volume mount your projects $APPSHELL_REGISTRY directory so the host can generate the global registry index. `./appshell_registry:/appshell/appshell_registry`

```bash
docker compose up appshell
```
